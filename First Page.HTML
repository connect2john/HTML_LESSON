The best thing you can do while pursuing any goal that you have in your life is to feel really good while taking the steps towards that goal.<br/> 
In order for this to happen, you just need to do 3 things:<br/>
	1. Make your goal very specific.<br/>
	2. Think about the goal and the possible steps to get there over and over again and take those steps when you feel itâ€™s appropriate to do so.<br/>
	3. Relax efficiently whenever you get into negative states like frustration, anger, boredom, disappointment, etc. and<br/>
	   Continue taking the steps towards your goal only after you transition from any of these states to a very pleasant feeling of relaxation.
