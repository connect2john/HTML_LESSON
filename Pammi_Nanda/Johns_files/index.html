                    Pammi Nanda Foundation has existed on the basic principle of equality for all and especially to those who do not possess it.
                    An innumerable number of the underprivileged population aspires to be the beneficiary of socio-economic and medical schemes.<br><br>

                 <h2>OUR MISSON</h2><br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Our mission</strong> has sought to provide for the underprivileged with education and to contribute to society positively and advance human achievement.
                    We believe that education is the paramount pre-requisite of a comfortable life and everyone should have a stake in being informed, as knowledge is power, which eventually leads to progress.<br><br>
                    We strengthen our foundation everyday by providing to the needy and to make thousands of people happy by providing education.
                    Over the past <strong>08</strong> years our mission and vision have guided us through transformations in the foundation, the communities we serve, and the society at large.<br><br>
                    To see a smile on somebody’s face who didn’t have a reason to do so is the greatest part about our initiative.
                    Not only does it leave our hearts content but also benefits the society at large to the path of progress and development.
                    We believe that there exists an inherent opportunity for all people, but around us, too many people are excluded from the socio-economic, medical and social institutions that shape their lives.
